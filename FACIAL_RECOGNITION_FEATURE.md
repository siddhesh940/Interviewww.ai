**Capabilities**:
- Mock facial analysis generation (ready for face-api.js integration)
- Emotion detection and scoring algorithms
- Confidence calculation based on multiple facial factors
- Engagement scoring using active vs passive emotion ratios
- Stress level assessment
- Intelligent suggestion generation

### 3. API Endpoints
**Location**: `src/app/api/facial-analysis/route.ts`

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/facial-analysis?call_id={id}` - Retrieve existing or generate new facial analysis
- `POST /api/facial-analysis` - Process video and generate facial analysis

## üìä Analysis Metrics

### Emotion Detection
- **Happy**: Positive expressions, smiles
- **Neutral**: Calm, focused expressions  
- **Nervous**: Anxious, uncertain expressions
- **Confused**: Puzzled, uncertain expressions
- **Surprised**: Reactive, engaged expressions
- **Angry**: Frustrated or tense expressions

### Scoring System
- **Confidence Index (0-100)**:
  - 75-100: Excellent confidence
  - 60-74: Good confidence 
  - Below 60: Needs improvement
  
- **Engagement Score (0-100)**:
  - Based on active vs passive emotional expressions
  - Measures attentiveness and responsiveness
  
- **Stress Indicator (0-100)**:
  - Higher scores indicate more visible stress
  - 70+: High stress, 40-69: Moderate, <40: Low stress

### Additional Metrics
- **Eye Contact Percentage**: Measures direct camera engagement
- **Smile Frequency**: Natural positive expressions
- **Head Stability**: Posture and presence indicators

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Real-time Analysis with face-api.js
Replace mock analysis with actual computer vision:

```typescript
// Future implementation example
import * as faceapi from 'face-api.js';

export const initializeFaceAPI = async () => {
  await Promise.all([
    faceapi.nets.tinyFaceDetector.loadFromUri('/models'),
    faceapi.nets.faceLandmark68Net.loadFromUri('/models'),
    faceapi.nets.faceExpressionNet.loadFromUri('/models')
  ]);
};

export const analyzeVideoFrames = async (video: HTMLVideoElement) => {
  const detections = await faceapi
    .detectAllFaces(video, new faceapi.TinyFaceDetectorOptions())
    .withFaceLandmarks()
    .withFaceExpressions();
  
  // Process detections to generate analysis results
};
```

### Advanced Features
- **Real-time emotion tracking** during live interviews
- **Micro-expression detection** for deeper insights
- **Comparative analysis** against industry benchmarks
- **Voice-emotion correlation** with sentiment analysis
- **Cultural sensitivity adjustments** for diverse candidates
